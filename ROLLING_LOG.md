# ROLLING LOG — Arcade Assistant

## 2026-02-15 | Valentine's Day Session
**Net Progress**: Built complete 5-piece Playnite Restore Toolkit (Fix-ArcadePaths, Restore-ArcadeAssistant, Launch-Sanity-Check, Backup-Creator, run_all_remediation.bat). Fixed Score Pipeline (5 breaks). Completed A:\ drive anatomy for Infrastructure as Code. Diagnosed Playnite extension load failure (BadImageFormatException). All pushed to Valentine-s-Day repo commit `6f74194`.
**Next**: Source Golden Backup via Playnite Auto-scan, configure Game Scanners, run overnight metadata scrape.
- 2026-02-21: Fixed CI/CD sync, deployed new Blinky UI with TTS-enabled chat drawer and pulsing mic.

## 2026-02-22 | Gunner Panel Redesign (Phase 1)
**Net Progress**: Full Gunner codebase audit (~5,700 lines). Redesigned Gunner panel from monolithic 946-line `LightGunsPanel.jsx` into 11-file modular architecture in `components/gunner/`. Created: `GunnerPanel.css` (full cyber/neon design system with Orbitron font, scanlines, glitch animations), `GunnerPanel.jsx` (orchestrator), `GunnerHeader.jsx`, `GunnerNav.jsx`, `GunnerAlertBar.jsx`, `DevicesTab.jsx`, `DeviceCard.jsx`, `SensorGrid.jsx`, `ConnectionMatrix.jsx`, `GunnerChatSidebar.jsx`, `useGunnerChat.js` (AI chat hook with Gemini tool schemas). Swapped import in `Assistants.jsx`. Clean build verified (1.81s), `gunner-panel` class confirmed in dist bundle. Initial build served stale cache — fixed with dist wipe + clean rebuild.
**Status**: Awaiting visual confirmation after user machine restart.
**Next**: Visually verify panel renders correctly. Then build Phase 2: Calibration tab, Profiles tab, Retro Modes tab, voice controls integration, live `gunnerClient.js` API wiring.

## 2026-02-23 | Infrastructure & VUI Milestone
**Net Progress**: Fixed consent save 403 (added `.aa/`-prefixed sanctioned paths to manifest). Integrated `httpx` broadcast into `scorekeeper.py` REST endpoints (`apply_score_submit`, `game_autosubmit`) for instantaneous WebSocket leaderboard push. Built Vicky Voice phase indicator bridges (`isSpeaking` state, `currentPhase` badge: 🎤→🧠→🔊→💤). Extracted `useGemSpeech` hook. 237 modules, 0 errors.
**Next**: End-to-end test consent UI flow, verify real-time score broadcast with ScoreKeeper panel, Gunner Phase 2.
